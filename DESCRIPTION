Title: To Explore Tweets From @year_progress
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Fran Barton
Maintainer: Fran Barton <fbarton@alwaysdata.net>
Description: I was randomly interested in whether there might be patterns
    in the amount of interaction with tweets from the **@year_progress** bot
    during 2020 :scream:,
    and what the shape of the year might look like compared to 2019.
